  # Deprecation of :manage
  # ---------------------------------
  # CanCanCan best practice seems to indicate it's better to give permissions than to take them away.
  # Using :manage impedes this because it grants permissions on all actions.
  # This means one has to use cannot to revoke some of those later in the file if necessary.
  # Having multiple places where a permission is defined (given, taken away, given again) is confusing
  # and can prevent the definition of a scope for use with accessible_by.
  # So we are moving away from using :manage, preferring to grant permissions explicitly instead.
  #
  # When refactoring away from :manage, be sure to account for all permissions that may be getting checked
  # at runtime. Places to look are:
  # - Throughout this file
  # - Throughout this gist https://gist.github.com/cooperka/47f50bd17f854e25ec179b382d9e9e4f
  #   which was created by grepping:
  #     - Throughout the app by grepping can?, cannot?, authorize!, and accessible_by
  #     - The routes file (are there any custom actions combined authorize_resource?-if so, consider using
  #       skip_authorize_resource and using a stock permission unless the custom one is really needed.)
