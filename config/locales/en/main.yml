        ## Qualifiers

        A simple search such as:

        * __romeo juliet__

        searches the answers to questions. To search on response attributes, use a qualifier, e.g.:

        * __form:Widgets__

        will only show responses to the 'Widgets' form.

        Combine both of the above to narrow your search:

        * __romeo juliet form:Widgets__

        will show responses to the 'Widgets' form containing the words 'romeo' and 'juliet'.

        The full set of qualifiers you can use is as follows:

        * __form__ The responses's form
        * __submitter__ The name of the user that submitted the response (partial matches allowed)
        * __group__ The name of a user group to which the submitting user belongs (partial matches allowed)
        * __submit-date__ The date the response was submitted (e.g. 1985-03-22)
        * __reviewed__ Whether the response has been marked 'reviewed' (1 = yes or 0 = no)
        * __source__ The medium via which the response was submitted ('web', 'odk', or 'sms')

        ## Exact Phrases

        Exact phrases can be matched by enclosing the phrase in double quotes:

        * __submitter:"John Smith"__

        Double quoted phrases can currently only be used with qualifiers other than "text".

        ## All Terms vs. Any Term

        By default, all terms in the search must be matched. For example,

        * __alpha lima peru__

        matches only responses with all three of those words. Use the vertical bar ('|') character to match several words/phrases:

        * __form:( Lions | "Bears and Sharks" | Tigers )__

        matches responses for any of the above forms. The '|' can only be used with qualifiers other than "text".

        ## Operators

        You can negate a qualified search by using the negation operator:

        * __form != Widgets__

        will match responses for any form except the 'Widgets' form.

        For answer searches, negation works differently:

        * __ballot -box__

        will match any response with an answer containing the word 'ballot' but not the word 'box'. There must be at least one non-negated term in any such search.

        For some qualifiers (e.g. __submit-date__), greater-than and less-than comparisons are also allowed:

        * __submit-date > 2000-01-01__

        Several of these can be combined to narrow the search to a range:

        * __submit-date >= 2000-01-01 submit-date < 2000-02-01__

        will match responses submitted in the month of January 2000.

      users: |-
        ## Qualifiers

        A simple search such as:

        * __romeo juliet__

        matches user names, login IDs, and emails on each word. To search based on specific attributes, use a qualifier, e.g.:

        * __email:@example.com__

        will search for users with email addresses matching '@example.com'.

        Combine both of the above to narrow your search:

        * __Susan email:@example.com__

        will search for users named Susan with an example.com email address.

        You can match blank values using '[blank]':

        * __phone: [blank]__

        The full set of qualifiers you can use is as follows:

        * __email__ The user's email address
        * __group__ The user's group membership
        * __login__ The user's login name
        * __name__ The user's full name
        * __phone__ The user's phone number (no dashes or other punctuation)
        * __role__ The user's role ('enumerator', 'reviewer', 'staffer', 'coordinator')


        Partial matches are allowed for all qualifiers.

        ## Exact Phrases

        Exact phrases can be matched by enclosing the phrase in double quotes:

        * __"john smith"__

        ## All Terms vs. Any Term

        By default, all terms in the search must be matched. For example,

        * __john smith__

        matches only users with 'john' and 'smith' both appearing in their name. Use the vertical bar ('|') character to match several names:

        * __abdul | juanita | clarice__

        The '|' character can also be used with qualifiers:

        * __email:( john@example.com | patty@foo.com )__

        matches users with any of the above email addresses.

        ## Negation

        You can negate a qualified search by using the negation operator:

        * __name != Oluwaseun__

        will match users not named 'Oluwaseun'.

      questions: |-
        ## Qualifiers

        A simple search such as:

        * __romeo juliet__

        searches the question titles for each word. To search based on question attributes, use a qualifier, e.g.:

        * __code:BallotBox__

        will show questions with 'BallotBox' in their code.

        Combine both of the above to narrow your search:

        * __romeo juliet code:BallotBox__

        will show questions with 'BallotBox' in their code whose titles also contain the words 'romeo' and 'juliet'.

        The full set of qualifiers you can use is as follows:

        * __title__ The question title (partial matches allowed)
        * __code__ The question code (partial matches allowed)
        * __type__ The question type (%{question_types})
        * __tag__ Searches tags applied to the question

        ## Exact Phrases

        Exact phrases can be matched by enclosing the phrase in double quotes:

        * __"the rain in spain"__

        Double quoted phrases can be mixed with non-quoted terms:

        * __apples oranges "passion fruit"__

        ## All Terms vs. Any Term

        By default, all terms in the search must be matched. For example,

        * __alpha lima peru__

        matches only questions with all three of those words. Use the vertical bar ('|') character to match several words/phrases:

        * __apples | oranges | "passion fruit"__

        The '|' character can also be used with qualifiers:

        * __code:( Lions | "Bears and Sharks" | Tigers )__

        matches questions with any of the above codes.

        ## Negation

        You can negate a qualified search by using the negation operator:

        * __code != Widgets__

        will match questions with any code not containing 'Widgets'.

      sms: |-
        ## Qualifiers ##

        A simple search such as:

        * __romeo juliet__

        searches the message content, username, user's full name, and phone number for each word.
        To search based on question attributes, use a qualifier, e.g.:

        * __type:incoming__

        will show incoming messages only.

        Combine both of the above to narrow your search:

        * __romeo juliet type:incoming__

        will show incoming messages that also contain the words 'romeo' and 'juliet'.

        The full set of qualifiers you can use is as follows:

        * __content__ The message content (partial matches allowed)
        * __type__ The message type (incoming, reply, or broadcast) (partial matches allowed)
        * __username__ The username of the sender or receiver (partial matches allowed)
        * __name__ The full name of the sender or receiver (partial matches allowed)
        * __number__ The phone number of the sender or receiver (partial matches allowed)
        * __date__ The date the message was sent or received (e.g. 2015-01-29)
        * __datetime__ The date and time the message was sent or received (use quotation marks and 24-hr time: e.g. "2015-01-29 14:00")

        ## Exact Phrases ##

        Exact phrases can be matched by enclosing the phrase in double quotes:

        * __"the rain in spain"__

        Double quoted phrases can be mixed with non-quoted terms:

        * __apples oranges "passion fruit"__

        ## All Terms vs. Any Term

        By default, all terms in the search must be matched. For example,

        * __alpha lima peru__

        matches only questions with all three of those words. Use the vertical bar ('|') character to match several words/phrases:

        * __apples | oranges | "passion fruit"__

        The '|' character can also be used with qualifiers:

        * __content:( Lions | "Bears and Sharks" | Tigers )__

        matches questions with any of the above codes.

        ## Negation

        You can negate a qualified search by using the negation operator:

        * __type != broadcast__

        will match messages whose type does not contain "broadcast".
