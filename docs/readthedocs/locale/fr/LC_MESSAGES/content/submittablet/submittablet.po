"ELMO does not typically allow the observer to finalize and send in forms "
"if there are required questions that haven’t been answered. However, some"
" situations may arise in which forms need to be submitted without "
"required questions being answered. For example, an observation may be "
"cancelled after observers have been deployed; the observers cannot "
"collect any new data, but the data they have collected is still "
"useful. These observers can bypass the required question and submit the "
"form by entering an override code. The override code is found and "
"regenerated as needed by mission coordinators on the settings page of "
"each mission, and then provided to observers when overrides are desired."

"**Note:** If code regeneration is deemed necessary, the best practice is "

"regeneration of codes should not be necessary."
