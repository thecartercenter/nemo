"Forms, Questions, and Option Sets can all be standardized in ELMO. "
"Standard Forms, Questions, and Option Sets eliminate the need for "
"observation groups to remake checklists for every mission, and allows "
"users to compare findings across missions. While election administration "
"is largely similar from country to country, specific regulations can vary"
" by country, and so should the design of the form, the questions in it, "
"and the answers available. ELMO allows for customized design of forms for"
" the mission at hand."

"Standardization in ELMO Forms is a major aspect of The Carter Center’s "
"overall `Democratic Election Standards project "
"<http://electionstandards.cartercenter.org/>`__. The project aims to "
"build consensus on obligations for democratic elections and on detailed "
"criteria for assessment by advancing the evolution of standards for "
"democratic elections and increasing shared knowledge on election "
"integrity, election observation, and democracy promotion. To do so, the "
"project uses a `framework of obligations "
"<https://eos.cartercenter.org/>`__ derived from public international law,"
" collaborates with the international elections community, and develops "
"practical tools – like ELMO – for observers to assess elections. Standard"
" Forms, Questions, and Option Sets not only allow for ease of mission "
"development, but also are used by The Carter Center to increase "
"coordination between the international elections community and human "
"rights mechanisms, providing capacity-building on international "
"obligations to civil society groups, build consensus on common indicators"
" for election quality with the academic community, measure the impact of "
"election observation, and maintain and develop shared knowledge on "
"observation methodology."
