# ELMO
ELMO is a mobile data collection and analysis web application. Originally designed for the [Carter Center](http://www.cartercenter.org) for election observation missions, ELMO can be used in many different contexts for data collection.

Consider ELMO if you need:

- Integrated form design
- Standardized form sets
- Multiple data entry paths, including web, ODK Collect, and SMS
- Multiple mission/project management
- Advanced user management with multiple permission levels
- SMS broadcasting
- Custom, real-time reporting
- Offline operation in poorly-connected areas

To learn more about the history and goals of the project, [visit the ELMO project site](http://getelmo.org).
You can also learn more about The Carter Center's Election Standards [here](http://cartercenter.org).

## Production Setup

For production scenarios, [Sassafras Tech Collective](http://sassafras.coop) offers managed production instances. Contact them for details. Or you can follow the [production setup guide](docs/production-setup.md) to setup an instance on an Ubuntu server.

## Contributing

ELMO is 100% open-source. We would like you to be part of the ELMO community! We accept and encourage contributions from the public. You can start by filing a bug report or feature request using a [Github issue](https://github.com/thecartercenter/elmo/issues).

Pull requests are also welcome, but discussing things first in an issue is always a good idea.

See the [development environment setup guide](docs/development-setup.md) to get started with the code.
